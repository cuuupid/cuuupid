## my red flags

- 100+ open source repositories that I never maintain and some 30 or so domains I bought once and will never use
- built a P2P scaling video conferencing product with AI in 2019 and killed it _right_ before COVID
- built tons of cool smartwatch apps for Pebble (still on Git!) only for it to get EOL'd ðŸ™ƒ
- built tons of VR apps and the first CAD -> VR workflow in 2013 then dropped it before Oculus blew up :boom:
- have been in ML since before Imagenet, but unfortunately means I started in Lua and remember when Tensorflow was a thing ðŸ˜±
- researched a multimodal transformer back in '20 but never made it past preprint
- owned BTC when it was pennies and sold at a loss, owned ETH at $2 and sold at a loss
- after 6 years of playing league I recently placed into Iron 3
