- one of the first smartwatch developers building apps for the Pebble watch, incl. a tool to turn your watch into a gesture-based controller for video games
- one of the first VR devs back in 2013 when Oculus dropped their first headset
- developed first VR workflow to go from CAD to game engine
- been around the ML community since the Imagenet challenge broke records, since character-level RNNs shook up NLP, and since ML was done in Lua (the dark ages, pre-Tensorflow and PyTorch)
- built attention-based LM's before Transformers were cool!
- owned BTC when it was pennies on the dollar, owned ETH when it was below $10
